Speaking of [AI Act details](https://minimizeregret.com/note/2024/03/14/ai-act-adopted-by-eu-parliament), the paper ["Demystifying the Draft EU AI Act” (Veale and Borgesius, 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03721) has been a real eye-opener and fundamental to my understanding of the regulation.[^1]

Different than most coverage of the regulation, the two law researchers highlight the path by which EU law eventually impacts practice: Via standards and company-internal self-assessments. This explains why you will be left wondering what human oversight and technical robustness mean after reading the AI Act. The AI Act purposely does not provide specifications practitioners could follow to stay within the law when developing AI systems. Instead, specifics are outsourced to the private European standardization agencies CEN and CENELEC. The EU Commission will task them with definition of standards (think ISO or DIN) that companies can then follow during implementation of their systems and subsequently self-assess. This is nothing unusual in EU law making (for example, it's used for medical devices and kids' chemistry sets). But, as the authors argue, it implies that "standardisation is arguably where the real rule-making in the Draft AI Act will occur".

Chapter III, section 4 "Conformity Assessment and Presumption" for high-risk AI systems, as well as chapters V and VI provide context not found anywhere else, leading up to strong concluding remarks:

> The high-risk regime looks impressive at first glance. But scratching the surface finds arcane electrical standardisation bodies with no fundamental rights experience expected to write the real rules, which providers will quietly self-assess against.

[^1]: As the paper's title suggests, it has been written in 2021 as a dissection of the EU Commission's initial proposal of the AI Act. Not all descriptions might apply to the current version adopted by the EU Parliament on Tuesday. Consequently the new regulation of foundation models, for example, is not covered.
