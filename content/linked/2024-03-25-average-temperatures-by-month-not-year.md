[This tweet](https://twitter.com/pmddomingos/status/1771992929940508795) is a prime example for why it's hard to analyze one signal in a time series (here, its trend) without simultaneously adjusting for its other signal components (here, its seasonality).

If the tweet gets taken down, perhaps this [screenshot on Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@wronglang/112157391033320552) remains.
