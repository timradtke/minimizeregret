Having browsed my thesaurus, I'm settling on *thoughtful* as the one word I'd choose to describe Jony Ive, as he is both deliberate in his words and stories and attentive to those who use his tools. *Tools*, not products, because Ive describes himself as a toolmaker.

Ive's description of his profession and work could come across as pretentious if Ive was less self-conscious and at times self-deprecating. Instead, presented in his thoughtful manner, Ive's attitude is the kind of stuff that gets you out of bed in the morning. Impart meaning to your work by caring to the extent that humans who interact with your work sense that someone cared.

This conversation is like a Happy Meal, full of little golden nuggets.
