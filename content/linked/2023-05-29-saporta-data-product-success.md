You might have heard this one before: To build successful data products, focus on the decisions your customers make. But when was the last time you considered "how your work get[s] converted into action"?

At Data Council 2023, Rick Saporta lays out a framework of what data products to build and how to make them successful with customers. He goes beyond the platitudes, his advice sounds hard-earned.
