We don't have enough presentations of industry practitioners discussing the detailed business problems they're addressing and what solutions and trade-offs they were able to implement. Tim Januschoswki did just that, though, in [his presentation at the International Symposium on Forecasting 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-f1G3qHb08). He discusses demand forecasting for optimal pricing at Zalando.

Presentations such as this one are rare opportunites to peak at the design of real world solutions. My [favorite quote](https://youtu.be/X-f1G3qHb08?feature=shared&t=693):

> What we're not using that might be also interesting is weather data. My business counterparts, they always, you know, make me aware of that fact. But we're not using it.
