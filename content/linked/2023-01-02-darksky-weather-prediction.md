Russel Jacobs for Slate on the discontinued Dark Sky weather app, via [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/01/02/jacobs-dark-sky):

> Indeed, Dark Sky’s big innovation wasn’t simply that its map was gorgeous and user-friendly: The radar map was the forecast. Instead of pulling information about air pressure and humidity and temperature and calculating all of the messy variables that contribute to the weather--a multi-hundred-billion-dollars-a-year international enterprise of satellites, weather stations, balloons, buoys, and an army of scientists working in tandem around the world (see Blum’s book)--Dark Sky simply monitored changes to the shape, size, speed, and direction of shapes on a radar map and fast-forwarded those images. “It wasn’t meteorology,” Blum said. “It was just graphics practice.”

Reminds me of [DeepMind's](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/nowcasting-the-next-hour-of-rain) ["Skilful precipitation nowcasting using deep generative models of radar"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03854-z).
