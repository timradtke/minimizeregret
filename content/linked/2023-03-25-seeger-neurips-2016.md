Oldie but a goodie: A [recording of Matthias Seeger's presentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/neural-information-processing-systems-conference-nips-2016/bayesian-intermittent-demand-forecasting-large-inventories) of "Bayesian Intermittent Demand Forecasting for Large Inventories" at NeurIPS 2016. The [corresponding paper](https://www.amazon.science/publications/bayesian-intermittent-demand-forecasting-for-large-inventories) is a favorite of mine, but I only now stumbled over the presentation. It sparked an [entire](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07638) [catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05264) [of](https://www.amazon.science/publications/probabilistic-demand-forecasting-at-scale) [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110) [on](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/gasthaus19a.html) [time series forecasting](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/hash/5cf68969fb67aa6082363a6d4e6468e2-Abstract.html) by Amazon, and like few others called out the usefulness of [sample paths](https://minimizeregret.com/post/2022/07/25/use-sample-paths/).
