Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, declared her intent to communicate the shortcomings of the ECB's forecasts better---and in doing so, provides applied data science lessons for the rest of us. As [quoted by the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/afe704e3-291c-4a06-8106-b235955970e2):

> "Even if these [forecast] errors were to deplete trust, we can mitigate this if we talk about forecasts in a way that is both more contingent and more accessible, and if we provide better explanations for those errors," Lagarde said.
