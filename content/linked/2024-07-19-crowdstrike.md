Days like today serve as a reminder that software doesn't have to be AI to bring high-risk infrastructure to a halt. From [Code Responsibly](https://minimizeregret.com/note/2023/11/12/code-responsibly):

> Regulating AI is awkward. Where does the if-else end and AI start? Instead, consider it part of software as a whole and ask in which cases software might have flaws we are unwilling to accept.
We need responsible software, not just responsible AI.

Thanks to everyone who has to spend the weekend cleaning up.
