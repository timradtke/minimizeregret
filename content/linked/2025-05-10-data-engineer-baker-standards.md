Over at Hermit Tech, Jordan Andersen laments over embarrassingly low project delivery expectations within the software and data industry when compared to other professions such as the one of a baker. His concern, however, is not only with the customers of the project, but with the developers:

> The latter consequence of low expectations is the more serious one. It's something that some people may never recover from. [...] The trajectory of a data or software engineer seems to be a bit different: they burn out from the mental stress of working in dishonest and fraudulent cultures that produce unsatisfying work, but the engineer stays in the profession. Only they're a shell of a human.
