Straight from my YouTube recommendations, a [PyData London 2018 (!) presentation by Charles Masson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zpg9ODE6Ww) of Datadog. To predict whether server metrics cross a threshold, he builds a method model that focuses on being robust to all the usual issues of anomalies and structural breaks. He keeps it simple, interpretable, and--for the sake of real-time forecasting--fast. Good stuff all around. The GIFs are the cherry on top.
