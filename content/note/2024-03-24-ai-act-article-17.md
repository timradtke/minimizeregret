Article 17 of the [AI Act adopted by the EU Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2024-0138_EN.html) is the ideal jump-off point into other parts of the legislation. While article 16 lists the "Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems", Article 17 describes the main measure by which providers can ensure compliance: the quality management system.

> That system shall be documented in a systematic and orderly manner in the form of written policies, procedures and instructions, and shall include at least the following aspects [...]

Note that providers write the policies themselves. The policies have to cover aspects summarizing critical points found elsewhere in the document, as for example the development, quality control, and validation of the AI system. But also...

- a description of the [applied harmonized standards](https://minimizeregret.com/linked/2024/03/16/demystifying-the-draft-eu-ai-act/) or other means to comply with the requirements for high-risk AI systems as set out in Section 2,
- procedures for data management such as analysis, labeling, storage, aggregation, and retention,
- procedures for post-marketing monitoring as in Article 72, incident notification as in Article 73, and record-keeping as in Article 12, and
- procedures for communication with competent authorities, notified bodies, and customers.

This doesn't necessarily sound all that exciting and might be glossed over on first reading, but search for Article 17 in the AI Act and you'll find the quality management system listed as *the* criterion alongside technical documentation in the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems that providers perform themselves (Annex VI) or that notified bodies perform for them (Annex VII).

Quality management systems are the means by which providers can self-assess their high-risk AI systems against official standards and comply with the regulation and thus central to the reading of the AI Act.
